  The future is certainly uncertain ha. It will be interesting if the world
  becomes more reliant on a more locally based business system but I'm sure the
  big boys will still ensure this is not the case so the big CEO's can still
  earn thier millions. It will be nice if the smaller local businesses are the
  ones who survive. I must say it shocks me that the people getting big rental
  incomes, rate payers and such like have said that there will be no increases
  in the foreseeable future. Is this the best they can do??? Meanwhile
  healhworkers and doctors are dying. As you say we must look after our internal
  worlds, I cant even imagine the stress for some, for me its easy to say stay
  positive.  I'm so glad our prime minister continues to encourage kindness, its
  gorgeous. As for the vaccine,  that in itself is a scary thought. The world is
  definately a different place.
